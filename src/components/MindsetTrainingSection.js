          <p>
            The goal of early training is to create a foundation of performance,
            perspective skills, and strategies that are supported over time to create
            a more refined, mature approach to performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to provide a foundation of mental and coping skills that
            will give young athletes the best chance to perform and excel in any moment,
            regardless of the competitionâ€”and this alone is a great reason for
            conducting mental skills training.
