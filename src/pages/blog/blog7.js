            <h2 className="mt-5">Tryout Tips: How to Stand Out and Make the Team</h2>

            <p>Included in the group of hopefuls are players that fall into five categories:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The ones who will surely make the team and know it.</li>
              <li>The ones who will surely make the team but don’t think they will.</li>
              <li>The ones who have a 50–50 chance of making the team.</li>
              <li>The ones with no chance but think they do.</li>
              <li>The ones with no chance and know it.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Assuming you're in category No. 3, your performance is what matters most. Here are 8 key tips to help you prepare and stand out:</p>

            <h3>1. Get Fit</h3>
            <p>You can’t control the coach, other players, or how you perform under pressure—but you can control your fitness. Arriving in top shape gives you a physical edge, shows your commitment, and builds your confidence.</p>

            <h3>2. Show Your Strengths</h3>
            <p>Identify what makes you special—dribbling, passing, leadership, etc.—and make sure that skill shows every day during tryouts.</p>

            <h3>3. Remain Positive</h3>
            <p>Coaches are not looking for complainers. Be encouraging, stay upbeat, and avoid negative comments or behavior.</p>

            <h3>4. Be Consistent</h3>
            <p>Give full effort all the time. You never know when someone is watching—even during water breaks or warm-ups.</p>

            <h3>5. Don’t Specialize</h3>
            <p>Be flexible and willing to play multiple positions. Coaches value versatility, and modern soccer demands all-around players.</p>

            <h3>6. Play Smart</h3>
            <p>Make good decisions. Don’t overdo it trying to impress—play within the game and show your awareness.</p>

            <h3>7. Pay Attention</h3>
            <p>Listen when the coach is talking. Don’t be the player asking about instructions that were just explained.</p>

            <h3>8. Relax</h3>
            <p>Nerves can kill your performance. Stay calm and focused so your training can take over.</p>
