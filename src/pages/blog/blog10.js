              Top 5 Mistakes Sports Parents Make (And What To Do Instead)
            </h1>

            <p className="fs-5">
              Raising an athlete is a joy ride with sudden turns—big wins, tough
              losses, and everything in between. Most parents want to help, but
              even with the best intentions it’s easy to reinforce the wrong
              things. Below are the five most common mistakes we see—and concrete
              ways to fix them fast.

              1) Mistaking Activity for Progress
            </h2>
            <p className="fs-5">
              <strong>The trap:</strong> Packing the calendar with practices,
              clinics, and private sessions feels productive. But more hours
              ≠ better results.
            </p>
            <p className="fs-5">
              <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Activity is visible; adaptation
              is not. Without a specific goal and feedback loop, you’re stacking
              mileage—not progress.

            <ol className="fs-5">
              <li>
                <strong>Define a measurable target</strong> (one per week).
                <em> Examples:</em> “Make 8/10 free throws under fatigue,”
                “Shave 0.2s off the 10m sprint,” “Land 7/10 first serves to the
                backhand.”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Design the rep plan</strong> that matches the target
                (volume + difficulty + fatigue).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Measure &amp; review</strong> every Friday. Did we hit
                the target? If not, what blocked it?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Adjust</strong> next week (more constraints, fewer reps,
                or better recovery).
              </li>

                Pro tip: Keep a simple scorecard on the fridge. If you can’t
                name last week’s target and result, you were busy—not progressing.

              2) Believing Talent Is the Deciding Factor
            </h2>
            <p className="fs-5">
              <strong>The trap:</strong> Talking about “natural ability” steals
              attention from what actually compounds: quality reps + coaching +
              environment.
            </p>
            <p className="fs-5">
              <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Talent is seductive. It explains
              early success but doesn’t predict who thrives at 15, 18, or 22.

                Praise <strong>behaviors</strong> you want repeated: “Loved how

              Your job isn’t to be the coach, trainer, or talent scout. It’s to
              build the environment where skill transfers to performance—
              consistently. When you shift from <em>more</em> to <em>better</em>,
              from talent talk to process habits, progress accelerates.
